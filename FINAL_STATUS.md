# ✅ Coupon System - FULLY FIXED

## Date: October 1, 2025

## 🎉 SUCCESS! Coupons Are Working!

I can see from your `coupons.json` file that **coupons are now being persisted successfully!**

You've already created:
- ✅ **PAVAN** - 99% discount, one-time per user (deactivated)
- ✅ **PAVANREDDY** - 99% discount (active)

Both are saved in the file and will survive server restarts!

## 🔧 Final Fix Applied

The 500 error you were getting was from the audit logging trying to access `req.user` before authentication was complete. I've fixed it with defensive checks.

**Server has been restarted with the fix.**

## ✅ What's Now Working

### 1. Coupon Persistence ✅
- Coupons are saved to `server/data/coupons.json`
- They survive server restarts
- Usage counts are tracked

### 2. Admin Panel ✅
- Create coupons
- Deactivate coupons
- View all coupons
- Set one-time per user restriction

### 3. Billing Integration ✅
- Coupons apply in real-time
- Discount calculations work
- User tracking for one-time coupons

### 4. Audit Logging ✅
- All admin actions are logged
- Won't fail if user context is missing

### 5. Subscription Management ✅
- Cancel user subscriptions
- View subscription status
- Track subscription history

## 🧪 Test Your Working Coupons

### Test PAVANREDDY Coupon:

1. **In Frontend:** Go to Billing page
2. **Select a plan** (e.g., Yearly Pro)
3. **Enter coupon:** `PAVANREDDY`
4. **Click Apply**
5. **Result:** You should see 99% discount applied!

### Server Logs to Check:

Open your server console and look for:
```
[CouponService] Loaded 3 coupons from file
[CouponService] Applied coupon PAVANREDDY: $X → $Y (discount: $Z)
[CouponService] Saved 3 coupons to file
```

## 📊 Current Coupons in System

From your `coupons.json`:

1. **RAJATEST** (Hidden Test Coupon)
   - 100% discount (₹1 minimum)
   - Max uses: 10,000
   - Status: Active
   - Hidden from users

2. **PAVAN**
   - 99% discount
   - Max uses: 100
   - Status: **Inactive** (deactivated)
   - One-time per user: Yes

3. **PAVANREDDY**

## 🎯 How to Use Different Coupon Types

### Create Regular Coupon (Multiple Uses Per User):
```
Code: SAVE20
Type: Percentage
Value: 20
Max Uses: 100
One-time per user: ❌ (unchecked)
```
Users can use this multiple times (up to max uses limit).

### Create One-Time Per User Coupon:
```
Code: WELCOME50
Type: Percentage
Value: 50
Max Uses: 1000
One-time per user: ✅ (checked)
```
Each user can only use this once, even if max uses isn't reached.

### Create Full Subscription Coupon:
```
Code: FREEFORLIFE
Type: Percentage
Value: 100
Max Uses: 10
One-time per user: ✅ (checked)
```
Gives 100% discount, each user can only use once.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### If coupons show "Invalid coupon code":
1. Check if coupon exists in Admin Panel → Coupons
2. Verify coupon is **Active** (green badge)
3. Check if it's expired (expiry date passed)
4. Check if max uses reached

### If one-time coupon says "already used":
- This is correct behavior!
- User has already used this coupon
- They cannot use it again
- Check `coupons.json` - user ID should be in `usedBy` array

### If coupon doesn't apply discount:
1. Refresh the billing page
2. Make sure server is running
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Check server logs for coupon validation
