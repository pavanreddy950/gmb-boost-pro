## 📞 Customer Support Script Example

**Customer:** "I'm not getting enough customers from Google."

**You:** "I can help you with that! Let me pull up your business profile audit. What's your email address?"

*[Search and view audit]*

**You:** "Okay, I'm looking at your profile for [Business Name]. I can see you're getting about 500 impressions per month, but only 10 calls. The good news is your impressions are up 15% from last month!"

*[Check recommendations]*

**You:** "I see a high-priority recommendation here - your business profile is only 60% complete. That's limiting your visibility. Let me walk you through what's missing..."
