# Keyword Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
Custom keywords typed in the autoposting tab were not being used when posts were created (both test posts and scheduled automated posts).

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Frontend Issue (AutoPostingTab.tsx) ✅ FIXED
**Location:** Line 628 in `handleTestNow` function

**Problem:** When clicking "Test Now", the code was using `config.keywords` instead of the current `keywords` state array.

**Fix:** Changed from:
```typescript
keywords: config.keywords || 'quality service, customer satisfaction',
```

To:
```typescript
keywords: keywords.length > 0 ? keywords.join(', ') : 'quality service, customer satisfaction',
```

This ensures test posts use your manually typed keywords.

### 2. Backend Issue (automation.js) ✅ FIXED
**Location:** Lines 37-44 and 57-65 in `/server/routes/automation.js`

**Problem:** When updating automation settings, if `settings.autoPosting` already existed (which happens after the first save), the backend code would ONLY update the `userId` field and **completely ignore all other incoming properties**, including your custom keywords!

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
} else {
  settings.autoPosting.userId = settings.userId || 'default';
}
```

**After (FIXED):**
```javascript
} else {
  // Preserve all incoming autoPosting properties (including keywords!)
  settings.autoPosting.userId = settings.userId || settings.autoPosting.userId || 'default';
  // Ensure keywords from autoPosting settings are preserved
  if (settings.autoPosting.keywords === undefined && settings.keywords) {
    settings.autoPosting.keywords = settings.keywords;
  }
}
```

The same issue was also fixed for `autoReply` settings.

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Clear existing settings** (optional but recommended):
   - Go to the autoposting tab
   - Disable auto-posting
   - Wait 2 seconds
   - Re-enable it

2. **Add your custom keywords:**
   - Type your keywords in the keyword field
   - Click the "+" button to add them
   - You should see them appear as badges

3. **Test the keywords:**
   - Click "Test Now" button
   - Check the generated post content
   - Your custom keywords should be incorporated into the post

4. **Verify automated posts:**
   - Enable auto-posting with your custom keywords
   - Wait for the scheduled time (or use test mode "test30s")
   - Check the generated posts - they should use your keywords

## Additional Improvements

- Added console logging to track keyword flow:
  - Frontend logs when keywords are updated
  - Backend logs when keywords are received
  - Backend logs what keywords are saved

Check browser console and backend logs to verify keywords are flowing correctly.

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/ProfileDetails/AutoPostingTab.tsx` - Fixed test post keyword usage
2. `server/routes/automation.js` - Fixed backend keyword preservation

## Next Steps

You need to **restart your backend server** for the changes to take effect:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

Or if running on Azure, redeploy the backend changes.
