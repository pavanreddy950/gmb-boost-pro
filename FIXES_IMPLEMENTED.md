# Fixes Implemented for GBP Disconnection and Billing Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Google Business Profile Disconnection Issue ✅
**Problem**: Tokens were being stored only in memory and lost on server restart because Firebase wasn't properly configured.

**Solution**:
- Added Firebase configuration placeholders to `.env.local`
- The server is already set up to use Firestore token storage but was failing due to missing service account
- Token storage class is properly implemented and ready to use

### 2. Billing Card Details Popup Appearing Repeatedly ✅
**Problem**: The subscription context was making too frequent API calls and showing upgrade modals even for paid users.

**Solutions**:
- Reduced subscription status check frequency from 5 minutes to 30 minutes
- Fixed SubscriptionGuard logic to not show modals for active paid accounts
- Improved UpgradeModal dismiss behavior:
  - Trial users: Modal reappears after 5 minutes if dismissed
  - Expired users: Modal doesn't auto-reappear (user has more control)
- Added proper status checks to prevent showing modals for active subscriptions

### 3. Proper Autopay Setup for New Users ✅
**Problem**: New users weren't getting a proper autopay setup flow.

**Solution**:
- Improved TrialSetupModal with two clear options:
  1. **"Start Free Trial with Auto-Pay"** - Collects payment method upfront (₹1 authorization)
  2. **"Start Free Trial (Setup Payment Later)"** - Simple trial without payment setup
- Both options properly create trial subscriptions
- Better UX with clear messaging about what each option does

## Firebase Setup Instructions

To complete the GBP token persistence fix, you need to:

1. **Get Firebase Service Account Key**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project `gbp-467810-a56e2`
   - Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - Download the JSON file

2. **Add to Environment Variables**:
   - Open `server/.env.local`
   - Replace the commented line with your actual service account JSON:
   ```
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"gbp-467810-a56e2","private_key_id":"...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"...","client_id":"...","auth_uri":"...","token_uri":"...","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"...","client_x509_cert_url":"..."}
   ```

3. **Restart the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

After this setup, Google Business Profile connections will persist across server restarts.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes:
- `src/contexts/SubscriptionContext.tsx`: Reduced API call frequency
- `src/components/SubscriptionGuard.tsx`: Fixed modal display logic
- `src/components/UpgradeModal.tsx`: Improved dismiss behavior
- `src/components/TrialSetupModal.tsx`: Enhanced autopay setup flow

### Backend Changes:
- `server/.env.local`: Added Firebase configuration placeholders
- Existing token storage infrastructure is already properly implemented

### Key Improvements:
1. **Token Persistence**: Tokens will be stored in Firebase Firestore instead of memory
2. **Reduced API Calls**: Subscription checks happen every 30 minutes instead of 5 minutes
3. **Better User Control**: Users can dismiss payment modals without constant re-prompting
4. **Clear Autopay Options**: New users get clear choices for trial setup
5. **Proper Status Handling**: Active paid users won't see unnecessary payment prompts

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test GBP Connection Persistence**:
   - Connect your Google Business Profile
   - Restart the backend server
   - Check if the connection persists (after Firebase setup)

2. **Test Billing Modal Behavior**:
   - Log in as a paid user
   - Navigate through the dashboard
   - Verify no payment modals appear inappropriately

3. **Test New User Onboarding**:
   - Create a new account
   - Connect Google Business Profile
   - Try both trial setup options
   - Verify proper trial creation and navigation
