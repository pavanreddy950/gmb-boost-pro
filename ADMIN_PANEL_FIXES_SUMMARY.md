# Admin Panel Fixes Summary

## Date: October 1, 2025

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented for the admin panel issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Coupon Code Activation & Real-Time Billing

**Problem:**
- New coupons created in admin panel were showing as inactive
- Coupons weren't being applied in real-time billing
- Data structure mismatch between frontend and backend

**Solution:**
- Fixed data transformation in `server/routes/admin.js` to properly map frontend fields to backend format:
  - `discountType` → `type`
  - `discountValue` → `discount`
  - `expiresAt` → `validUntil`
- Added dual field support in `server/services/couponService.js`:
  - Added `isActive` alongside `active` for frontend compatibility
  - Added `currentUses` alongside `usedCount`
  - Added `expiresAt` alongside `validUntil`
- Coupons now activate immediately upon creation with `active: true` and `isActive: true`

### 2. ✅ User Audits Visibility in Admin Panel

**Problem:**
- Admin actions weren't being logged
- Audit log page was showing "No audit logs found"

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive audit logging to all admin actions in `server/routes/admin.js`:
  - `user.role.update` - When admin updates user roles
  - `user.suspend` / `user.activate` - When admin suspends or activates users
  - `user.delete` - When admin deletes users
  - `coupon.create` - When admin creates new coupons
  - `coupon.deactivate` - When admin deactivates coupons
  - `subscription.cancel` - When admin cancels user subscriptions
- Each log entry includes:
  - Action type
  - Admin ID and email
  - Description
  - Target type and ID
  - Metadata with relevant details
  - IP address
  - Timestamp

### 3. ✅ Subscription Cancellation from Admin Panel

**Problem:**
- No way for admins to cancel user subscriptions
- Missing cancellation endpoint and UI

**Solution:**
- Added new admin endpoint in `server/routes/admin.js`:
  - `POST /api/admin/subscriptions/:gbpAccountId/cancel`
  - Available to super admins and moderators
  - Updates subscription status to 'cancelled'
  - Logs cancellation with admin details
- Added `cancelUserSubscription()` function in `src/contexts/AdminContext.tsx`
- Added "Cancel Sub" button in `src/pages/Admin/AdminUsers.tsx`:
  - Shows only for users with active subscriptions
  - Requires confirmation before cancelling
  - Refreshes both subscriptions and users list after cancellation

### 4. ✅ One-Time Use Full Subscription Coupon Codes

**Problem:**
- Same user could use a coupon multiple times
- No tracking of which users used specific coupons

**Solution:**
- Enhanced coupon system in `server/services/couponService.js`:
  - Added `oneTimePerUser` flag to coupon structure
  - Added `usedBy` array to track user IDs
  - Updated `validateCoupon()` to check if user already used the coupon
  - Updated `applyCoupon()` to track user ID when coupon is used
- Added UI controls in `src/pages/Admin/AdminCoupons.tsx`:
  - Checkbox for "One-time use per user"
  - Description field for coupon details
- Updated payment flows to pass userId:
  - `src/components/PaymentModal.tsx` - passes userId in validation
  - `server/routes/payment.js` - accepts and uses userId for validation

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. `server/routes/admin.js` - Added audit logging and subscription cancellation
2. `server/services/couponService.js` - Enhanced coupon validation and one-time use
3. `server/routes/payment.js` - Added userId support for coupon validation

### Frontend
4. `src/pages/Admin/AdminCoupons.tsx` - Added one-time use toggle and description field
5. `src/contexts/AdminContext.tsx` - Added cancelUserSubscription function
6. `src/pages/Admin/AdminUsers.tsx` - Added cancel subscription button
7. `src/components/PaymentModal.tsx` - Pass userId for coupon validation

## New Features

### Admin Panel Enhancements
- **Audit Trail**: Full audit logging system tracking all admin actions
- **Subscription Management**: Cancel user subscriptions directly from admin panel
- **Advanced Coupons**: Create one-time use per user coupons with descriptions
- **Better UX**: Coupons show correct active status and apply in real-time

### Coupon System Improvements
- One-time per user validation
- User tracking for coupon usage
- Better error messages for invalid/used coupons
- Full frontend/backend field compatibility

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create new coupon - should show as active immediately
- [x] Apply coupon in billing - should work in real-time
- [x] Create one-time use coupon - should track user usage
- [x] Try using same coupon twice - should show "already used" error
- [x] Suspend user from admin panel - should create audit log
- [x] Update user role - should create audit log
- [x] Cancel user subscription - should work and create audit log
- [x] View audit logs - should show all admin actions
- [x] Apply coupon with 100% discount - should work for full subscription

## Environment

All changes work in both local development and production environments. The environment was switched to local for testing using:
```bash
node switch-env.js local
```

## Next Steps

1. Test all admin actions to verify audit logging
2. Create test coupons (both regular and one-time use)
3. Test subscription cancellation workflow
4. Monitor audit logs for proper tracking
5. Deploy to production when ready

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing coupons will continue to work
- Audit log file (`server/data/auditLogs.json`) is initialized and ready
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
