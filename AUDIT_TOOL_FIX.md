# Audit Tool Fix - Performance API Integration

## Problem Identified

The audit tool was showing "no data available" and the Google Cloud Console showed 300 requests/minute quota with 0% usage. The issue was:

1. **Using Deprecated API**: The code was calling the deprecated `Google My Business Insights API v4` which was sunset and no longer works
2. **Wrong API Endpoints**: Using `https://mybusiness.googleapis.com/v4/...` which returns errors

## Solution Implemented

Updated the backend endpoint `/api/locations/:locationId/audit/performance` to use the **Business Profile Performance API v1**:

### New API Details
- **API Name**: Business Profile Performance API
- **Version**: v1
- **Endpoint**: `https://businessprofileperformance.googleapis.com/v1/{location}:getDailyMetricsTimeSeries`
- **Documentation**: https://developers.google.com/my-business/reference/performance/rest

### Metrics Fetched
The updated code now fetches these metrics:
- `BUSINESS_IMPRESSIONS_DESKTOP_MAPS`
- `BUSINESS_IMPRESSIONS_DESKTOP_SEARCH`
- `BUSINESS_IMPRESSIONS_MOBILE_MAPS`
- `BUSINESS_IMPRESSIONS_MOBILE_SEARCH`
- `BUSINESS_CONVERSATIONS`
- `BUSINESS_DIRECTION_REQUESTS`
- `CALL_CLICKS`
- `WEBSITE_CLICKS`

## Required: Enable API in Google Cloud Console

To make this work, you **MUST** enable the API in your Google Cloud project:

### Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console
1. Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select your project: **gbp-467810**

### Step 2: Enable Business Profile Performance API
1. Go to: **APIs & Services** > **Library**
2. Search for: **"Business Profile Performance API"**
3. Click on it and press **"Enable"**

OR use this direct link:
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/businessprofileperformance.googleapis.com?project=gbp-467810

### Step 3: Verify OAuth Scopes
The current scopes should already include the necessary permissions:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/business.manage`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.business.manage`

If the Performance API requires additional scopes, you may need to re-authenticate users.

### Step 4: Check Quotas
After enabling:
1. Go to: **APIs & Services** > **Enabled APIs**
2. Find **Business Profile Performance API**
3. Click **Quotas** to see usage limits (default is usually 300 requests/minute)

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Restart the Backend Server
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test in the Application
1. Login to the application
2. Go to **Audit Tool** page
3. Select a business location
4. Click **Refresh** button
5. You should now see performance metrics and charts

### 3. Check Server Logs
Look for these log messages:
- `üåê Fetching performance metrics from Business Profile Performance API v1`
- `üì° Business Profile Performance API Response Status: 200`
- `‚úÖ Success with Business Profile Performance API v1`
- `üìä Retrieved X days of metrics`

### 4. Verify in Google Cloud Console
After testing:
1. Go back to **APIs & Services** > **Enabled APIs**
2. Click **Business Profile Performance API**
3. View the usage graph - you should now see API calls being made

## Expected Behavior After Fix

‚úÖ Audit tool loads real performance data
‚úÖ Charts show impressions, views, calls, website clicks, directions
‚úÖ No "data unavailable" error messages
‚úÖ Google Cloud Console shows API usage (no longer 0%)
‚úÖ Real-time metrics update every 5 minutes (if auto-refresh is enabled)

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see "no data available":

1. **Check API is Enabled**
   - Verify Business Profile Performance API is enabled in Cloud Console

2. **Check Authentication**
   - User must be authenticated with proper Google Business Profile access
   - May need to re-authenticate after enabling new API

3. **Check Location ID**
   - Verify the location ID is correct format
   - Should be just the numeric ID, not the full path

4. **Check Server Logs**
   - Look for error messages in the terminal where backend is running
   - Common errors: 403 (API not enabled), 401 (auth issue), 404 (wrong location ID)

5. **Check API Quotas**
   - Make sure you haven't exceeded quota limits
   - Default: 300 requests/minute should be sufficient

## Files Modified

- `server/server.js` (line 2362-2490): Updated `/api/locations/:locationId/audit/performance` endpoint
- Changed from deprecated `mybusiness.googleapis.com/v4` to `businessprofileperformance.googleapis.com/v1`
- Implemented proper date formatting and metric aggregation

## Important Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è The Google My Business API v4 is **deprecated** and will not work
- ‚úÖ You MUST use Business Profile Performance API v1 going forward
- üìä The new API provides more detailed metrics than the old one
- üîÑ Users may need to re-authenticate after enabling the new API
- üöÄ Once enabled, metrics will start appearing immediately

## Next Steps

1. **Enable the API** in Google Cloud Console (most important!)
2. **Restart backend server**
3. **Test the audit tool** with a real business location
4. **Monitor API usage** in Cloud Console to ensure it's working
5. **Check quotas** if you have many users - may need to request quota increase

**Status**: ‚úÖ Code Fixed - Waiting for API to be enabled in Google Cloud Console
